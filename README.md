Password Generator - Challenge 3

This week's Challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I will write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Process

First, I created a new GitHub Repository complete with starter code and ensured all assets were in the appropriately labeled folders

Second, I confirmed the CSS sheet and JS file were linked to the HTML correctly and tested the starter code. The HTML page loaded and displayed like the mockup but the red button did not work. The page was responsive to multiple screen sizes.

Then, I reviewed the starter code and began to pseudo code using the instructor example as a guide 

```
function generatePassword(){
  // All your code here
// var numChar = window.prompt
// console.log(numChar);
// var inclNums = window.confirm true/false

// array for each character type
// var numArray = ["0","1"]

// if statement
// var options =[];
  // if true push/concat that array into a new array var

// for loop through options array based on required characters
  // Random index value for every loop
  // Google this; How to randomly choose a value from an array
  // var chosenArr = [];
  // turn array into string

  return password;
}
```
